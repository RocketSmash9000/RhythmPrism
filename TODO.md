- Add audio effects to bus depending on what sound is playing.
	- Check if sound has associated effect.
	- Add associated effect to corresponding audio bus.
	- Remove effect to bus when polo is vanquished.
- Loop overhaul (cleanup legacy code, make more optimised).
- Create script/executable for easy mod making.
	- Will need to be able to select all sprites for every polo.
	- Let user make animations from interface.

- Add cinematic mode (let people put polos in certain times and then it plays it back without UI. Better control over replays). Will most likely be added after 1.0.
- Add version selector (each version will need its own resources, which means more directories yay!). Probably won't be added until after 1.0.
