- [Won't be fixed] Loop overhaul (cleanup legacy code, make more optimised).
	- THE ISSUE WAS THE FUCKING TIMER. Now the first time each loop is played (and loaded into memory) has an imperceptible lag spike (or at least that's how it should be).
- Create script/executable for easy mod making.
	- Will need to be able to select all sprites for every polo.
	- Let user make animations from interface.

- Add cinematic mode (let people put polos in certain times and then it plays it back without UI. Better control over replays). Will most likely be added after 1.0.
- Add version selector (each version will need its own resources, which means more directories yay!). Probably won't be added until after 1.0.
