- Muting, soloing and eliminating buttons.
	- The polo vanquisher has been added.
- Loop overhaul (cleanup legacy code, make more optimised).

- Add cinematic mode (let people put polos in certain times and then it plays it back without UI. Better control over replays). Will most likely be added after 1.0.
- Add version selector (each version will need its own resources, which means more directories yay!). Probably won't be added until after 1.0.
