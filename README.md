# RhythmPrism
A free and open source "tool" that aims for an easier experience during Incredibox mod development, as it removes most of the unnecesary work. With this tool you may now only need to add the polo sounds, animations and icons (with a few extra steps that aren't hard). No need to code or type anything hard to understand.

If you end up using this project, let me know what awesome stuff you've made with it! :D

## Your imagination is the limit!
The official Incredibox mods have a few limitations in what they can do, as they use the official Incredibox engine. This limits creative expression in the form of cool effects. No way to add more than 20 polos, wasted screen space, icons can't be animated... (at least it was that way last time I checked) there's so many problems with official Incredibox modding that I wanted to let everyone take back all we could do before official mods (yes I know RMB exists).

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This project is more aimed at web hosted versions (like on itch.io) than executables. You may, however, use this engine as you deem fit. Just know that you will most likely have to sign the executable if you make one for Windows to not flag it as potentially malicious. Same applies with MacOS.

I (RocketSmash) am not responsible for the misuse of this engine. This includes making copies of the actual game, viruses and/or distasteful joke mods (among others). I only give the means to make modding possible.

Take into account that RhythmPrism is still in its early stages of development. Even though it already works, some things may break or not work. If you have any features you want added, open an issue or DM me through Discord. I'm open to any suggestions. After all, this project is made for the community.

## Download the project
You can download RP from the [Releases](https://github.com/RocketSmash9000/RhythmPrism/releases/latest) tab. Decompress and import the project in Godot as seen in [Edit the project](https://github.com/RocketSmash9000/RhythmPrism/?tab=readme-ov-file#edit-the-project). Alternatively, you can clone the entire github repository using the steps below.

## Cloning the project
The only advantage of cloning is that updates are technically semi-automatic. If you alter the code, please **DO NOT** update (`git pull`), as it will likely mess with your project.

You can choose one of these options.

 5. Select the folder you want the repository to be in
 6. Click "Clone"

### Git command (Windows)
You will need to have Git installed.
 1. Open cmd or PowerShell in the folder you want the project cloned into. The folder should be empty.
 2. Type `git clone https://github.com/RocketSmash9000/RhythmPrism.git` into the terminal of your choice and hit enter.

### Git command (Linux)
You need Git (though most distros already have it installed)

 2. Type `git clone https://github.com/RocketSmash9000/RhythmPrism.git` and hit enter.

### Download from GitHub

## Contribute
If you'd like to help with this project, be it with sprites, code or suggestions, you're free to open a pull request or an issue.

## Edit the project
Open Godot Engine, click "Import" and select the `project.godot` file in the cloned project you made earlier. Then click on "Import & Edit".

You will need Godot 4.6 or higher to be able to open the project.

## Need help?
First look for issues related to your problem. It not always is a RhythmPrism issue. If that didn't resolve your issue, feel free to open an issue with a detailed description of your problem, DM me on Discord or read the wiki (empty right now).

If you need help with making a mod using RP, feel free to contact me. I'll try to help (if life allows it).

If you run into any issues, feel free to Google your problems, DM me in Discord, or open an issue in this project with the "derived" tag.
